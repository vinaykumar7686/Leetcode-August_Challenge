# Diagonal Traverse

'''
Given a matrix of M x N elements (M rows, N columns), return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image.

 

Example:

Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

Explanation:

 

Note:

The total number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.

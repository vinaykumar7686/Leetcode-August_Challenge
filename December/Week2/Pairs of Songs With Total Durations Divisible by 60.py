#  Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

'''
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
Example 2:

Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 

Constraints:

1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
1 <= time[i] <= 500
   Hide Hint #1  
We only need to consider each song length modulo 60.
   Hide Hint #2  
We can count the number of songs with (length % 60) equal to r, and store that in an array of size 60.

            else: # check if a%60+b%60==60
                ret += remainders[60-t%60]
            remainders[t % 60] += 1 # remember to update the remainders
        return ret

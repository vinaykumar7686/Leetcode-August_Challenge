# Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers

'''
Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

Return the sum of these numbers.

 

Example 1:



Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 1000.
node.val is 0 or 1.
The answer will not exceed 2^31 - 1.
   Hide Hint #1  
Find each path, then transform that path to an integer in base 10.

Morris Preorder Traversal.
We discussed already iterative and recursive preorder traversals, which both have great time complexity though use up to \mathcal{O}(H)O(H) to keep the stack. We could trade in performance to save space.

The idea of Morris preorder traversal is simple: to use no space but to traverse the tree.

How that could be even possible? At each node one has to decide where to go: to the left or to the right, traverse the left subtree or traverse the right subtree. How one could know that the left subtree is already done if no additional memory is allowed?

The idea of Morris algorithm is to set the temporary link between the node and its predecessor: predecessor.right = root. So one starts from the node, computes its predecessor and verifies if the link is present.

There is no link? Set it and go to the left subtree.

There is a link? Break it and go to the right subtree.

There is one small issue to deal with : what if there is no left child, i.e. there is no left subtree? Then go straightforward to the right subtree.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(N)O(N), where NN is a number of nodes.

Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(1)O(1).
